# ADT-Repository
A repository of ADTs

Feel free to modify and add to it.
(Note for C++) This collection is meant for more advanced algorithms and such, as there already exists built in functions for ADTs in a c++ library. To access that specific library, through the header #include <(ADT name)> similarly to vectors.
